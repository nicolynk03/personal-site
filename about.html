            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <div class="brief-about">
                <p>I have always been interetsed in applying technology to real life, whether it is solving a real-world problem, helping a friend, or to have fun (like video editting or building fun projects!).</p>
                <p>Originally from Indonesia, I went to the University of Tasmania (Australia) to pursue further study in Computer Science. It is also the place where I have made countless memories and skills, which is also when I got introduced to programming (both challenging and fun at the same time)! I also developed numerous skills and interests, especially in the area of software development (web and mobile application) and AI.</p>
                <p id="last-row-p">Outside of studies and developing (fun) projects, I can be found watching YouTube or browsing the Internet to learn interesting things (like languages or random facts) or watching YouTube tutorials on how to play my favourite songs on guitar. I am always eager to help wherever I can, especially in the digital world. I believe today is an opportunity for us to improve the world through technology, let's connect and keep in touch!</p>
